Day Three

This was our third day assignment at the Iron Yard.  Our assignment was to recreate the page given only a PDF to work from.  Our instructions were to create the page using our newly learned skills to recreate the page to the pixel.  This was the first built out page I had ever completed from scratch with HTML and CSS.  Everything from margin and padding to font-size and line height were all newly acquired and learned concepts.  This was also my first use of the hover state.

Below is a link to the live page:<BR>
